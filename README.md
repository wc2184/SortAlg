## Background
[Progress Scorecard - William Chan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CycAWjgwGE2KgE18jOjDsrCkxOyowdSeIYPTikBWjd8/edit#gid=80636460)

My project is SortAlg. I am making a sorting algorithm visualizer that shows how certain algorithms work at sorting a list of unordered numbers into ordered numbers. It will use a bar graph whose height represents the value of a number. And the bars will switch around live to represent how the sorting algorithm works. We will have all types of algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Binary Search, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and others. We will also display code for the sorting algorithm and show other details like time complexity.

## Functionality & MVPs

In SortAlg, users will be able to:

- Click a specific sorting algorithm button and then see the bar graph change live with the sorting algorithm.
- See the actual sorting algorithm implementation details in JavaScript code.
- Generate new Lists to sort to restart the visualization
- Change the speed of the algorithm and fast forward

### In addition, this project will include:
- See graphs and trees as well 
- Depth First Search and Breadth First Search
- Change color of the bar graphs/tree nodes
